    <p class="sit">For those wondering, the literal meaning of Brötchen in English is essentially “small bread”.
    “Brot” means bread in German and the ending “-chen” is sometimes added when you want to emphasize that you’re talking about something smaller.
    Brötchen – in English sometimes written as Brotchen since the German letter “ö” is not being used – is basically just the German word for bun or bread roll</p>
